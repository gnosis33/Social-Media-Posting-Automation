# Pseudocode for Platform Interface

# Class PlatformInterface (abstract):
#     Abstract method login():
#         # Platform-specific login process

#     Abstract method navigate_to_post_settings():
#         # Navigate to the post settings page on the platform

#     Abstract method upload_video(video_directory):
#         # Upload video from the provided directory

#     Abstract method add_post_details(video_directory):
#         # Add description, tags, and metadata to the post

#     Abstract method submit_post():
#         # Submit the post on the platform

# platform_interface.py file defines an abstract PlatformInterface class with abstract methods for logging in, navigating to post settings, uploading a video, adding post details, and submitting a post on a platform.
# The PlatformInterface class serves as a high-level modular structure for defining platform-specific implementations.
# The abstract methods in the PlatformInterface class provide a template for implementing platform-specific functionality in concrete platform classes.
# Concrete platform classes, such as TikTokPlatform (found in tiktok_platform.py), implement the abstract methods defined in the PlatformInterface class to provide platform-specific functionality.
# The platform_interface.py file helps in maintaining a consistent interface for interacting with different platforms, allowing for easy integration of new platforms in the future.

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# The methods in the PlatformInterface and its implementations (like TikTokPlatform) 
# need to be closely monitored for changes in the respective platform's UI or API to maintain functionality. 
# This requires ongoing maintenance and updates.
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
