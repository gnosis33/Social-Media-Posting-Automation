# login_manager.py is a Python script that defines a LoginManager class with methods for logging into multiple platforms.
# The class has an __init__ method that initializes a list of platforms, and a login_to_all_platforms method that iterates over each platform, logging into each one using the login method defined in the PlatformInterface class.
# Uses the selenium library to interact with the web interface of the platforms and perform the login process.



# # usage of the login_manager.py

# from tiktok_platform import TikTokPlatform
# # Import other platform classes here

# # Create instances of platform classes
# tiktok = TikTokPlatform()  # Assume this class has been properly set up
# # other_platform = OtherPlatform()

# # List of all platform instances
# platforms = [tiktok]

# # Initialize LoginManager with the platforms
# login_manager = LoginManager(platforms)

# # Login to all platforms
# login_manager.login_to_all_platforms()
